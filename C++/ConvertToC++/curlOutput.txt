                <title>One-minute phone breaks could help keep students more focused in class and better in tests</title>
                <description>Phones can be useful tools in classrooms to remind students of deadlines or encourage more exchange between students and teachers. At the same time, they can be distracting. Students report using their phones for non-academic purposes as often as 10 times a day. Thus, in many classrooms, phones are not allowed.</description>

                <title>State mandates requiring genocide education lack standards to guide teachers, study finds</title>
                <description>&quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; was a critically acclaimed and commercially successful film, but not necessarily the best way to teach high school students about a topic as fraught as genocide. Yet, without guidance on how to approach genocide throughout history, showing the movie in class may be what teachers default to in covering difficult and uncomfortable subjects.</description>

                <title>Western media outlets are trying to fix their coverage of Africa. Is it time African media did the same?</title>
                <description>Quick question: what do these titles have in common? A Dark Continent Seeking Light; Sure, Ebola is Bad. Africa has Worse, or; Magic and Cannibalism in the African Jungle. You guessed it—they're all about Africa. But the most correct answer is they're all headlines that have appeared in the prestigious New York Times newspaper.</description>

                <title>Farmer sentiment reaches lowest levels since 2016 as income expectations weaken</title>
                <description> In September, the Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer recorded its lowest readings since March 2016. Declining income expectations pushed farmer sentiment down as the barometer fell 12 points to 88, and the Index of Future Expectations dropped 14 points to 94. The Index of Current Conditions also fell 7 points to 76, which nearly matched levels seen in April 2020, during the height of COVID-19 concerns for farmers. This month's survey was conducted from Sept. 9–13, 2024.</description>
